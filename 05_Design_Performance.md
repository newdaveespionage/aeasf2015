Performance is User Experience

jank = scrolling jank

Performance + Aesthetics = User Experience

How quickly your page appears to load is more important than actual load time

Test everything, not all advice is directly applicable

Responsive image spec helps pick what users actually will download

ImageOptim

Optimizing reduced energy load for mobile (battery power)

@import only the font weights you absolutely need

Fonts / Icon fonts need documented subsetting if used to optimize fonts

Firefox 3D rendering of nested depth

Make sure there's a good reason to load things

Load something you control at smaller / lighter-weight screens

Create a culture of Performance

Compare experiences

Celebrate performance heroes

Show what it feels like
