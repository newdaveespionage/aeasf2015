Design Decisions Through the Lens of Performance
================================================

By Yesemia Perez-Cruz

Slow heavy websites are the result of poor:
- planning
- communication
- awareness

Design is a balancing act between:
- Performance
- Pretty

Fast sites:
- build trust
- are memorable

Shoppers:
- 2 seconds load
- will visit competitors site if it loads faster by 250ms

Tools can also contribute to slowdowns
