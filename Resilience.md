Resilience
==========

Communication methods
---------------------
- Line of sight towers
- Electric Morse code
  - Transatlantic Cable
  - Had the same paranoia (not real, staged)
  - Idealism (never have wars again)
- Arthur C. Clark (sp)
  - use sattelites orbiting at the rate earth spins
- Internet communication follows the majority of the submarine cable paths set up by telegraph cables
- Can the internet survive a nuclear attack? (probably not, but it is resilient)
- Packet switching
- Arpanet, first network communication was "lo" (after first two characters the network crashed)
- TCP/IP creation
  - avoids top-down control
- The internet is a dumb network (on purpose)
  - all packets are treated equally
- Tim Berners Lee read "Dial F For Frankenstein" by Arthur C. Clark as part of the inspiration of HTTP

HTML
----
- HTML formed from many existing behaviors (many elements were borrowed)
- 20+ elements at inception, now 121 elements, backwards compatible
- Fault tolerant
  - ignore tags you don't understand
  - display content
  - designed this way on purpose
- Responsive images
  - srcset
  - added to existing tag
  - picture and other tags ignored, src in img is still required, therefore backwards compatible

CSS
---

Very basic structure

``` css
.selector {

}
```

Preprocessors
Naming/Organizational conventions

The Robustness Principle
------------------------
"Be conservative in what you send, be liberal in what you accept"

These ideas work because CSS & HTML are declarative languages (instruction sets)

Javascript is imperative, needs
