Designing for Crisis
====================
*By Eric Meyer*

Navigating a site in a state of stress and disorientation isn't that far off from "the user is drunk" context idea.
Do not assume vocabulary translates 1:1 for all visitors to your site who are relevant.
Do not assume users know what they actually need.
Do not assume anyone will see your sidebar

Cognitive energy is limited. If it is expended in one place, the remaining may not be able to process things in the way anyone expects

What are users doing in a panic?
What are users doing when they are frustrated?
What are users doing when they are on the happy path?

Sometimes your users don't have a choice of interface

If someone is at your site in crisis, they feel they are there for a reason

Envision your context in different environments, who is really using in those environments?

Hipmunk filtering is really effective

If there are known issues with your site, add help context for the help. Don't assume that everything works. Have fallbacks.

Minimal changes to context makes all the difference. Adding promise of reward, and enhancing the interface (decorating) can be revolutionary.

Consuming cognative resources for testers:
- Be honest about what you're about to do, let them know you'll be using distracting methods. Respect their medical sensitivity.
- Use CSS to make parts of the page blur or shake
- Knock out content portions (every 5th) and check if users can translate
- Have them wear headphones and listen to distracting music

i wish i could have my own airline and be able to actually use design thinking from inception for the multiple customer experiences. #aeasf

@meyerweb check out the amazing UX that BC Children's Hospital did B4 building the new hospital  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjvN7iFLTrU&sns=tw … #aeasf #bcchf

@meyerweb was discussing crisis design around a java failure on an insurance site when a java update crashed his presentation. #aeasf

in a crisis, it's hard to think straight. what would someone see on your site if they needed information in that moment? @meyerweb #aeasf
it's common to test apps and sites with ideal users in ideal situations. who has "crisis user study" in their lineup? @meyerweb #aeasf
user edge case... is this the edge of who we care about? and if so, should it be? @meyerweb #aeasf
more about context — designs that work successfully in one context might fail miserably in another. @meyerweb #aeasf
use up your user study participant's cognitive resources with various odd effects to simulate use during crisis situations @meyerweb #aeasf

@meyerweb providing a vivid example of how context should shape content priority. #aeasf
Don't assume that your users are focusing 100% on your site when they use it. Because they're not. @meyerweb #aeasf
Ideal user experiences are generally not reminiscent of "The Shining" @meyerweb #aeasf
Intriguing idea from @meyerweb - turn-by-turn directions for walking (or sprinting) inside airport terminals. #aeasf
Ah, the good ol' "An error occurred". #aeasf #ragequit
Test usability in real-word situations: less focused, with tight time limits, surrounded by noise. @meyerweb #aeasf
New user test situation idea: Yakety Sax playing through the entire test, gradually getting louder as time progresses. Thoughts? #aeasf
Do things that will never be noticed. Users in crisis won't notice the roadblocks you've removed. Which is the point. @meyerweb #aeasf
