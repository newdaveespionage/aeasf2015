What do I do if my portfolio isn't indicative of me?

  - no longer relevant
Monotype
fonts.com
  - redesign: wanted to be loved
  - Trying to show engagement with the design community

Advice
------
Work never sells itself
  - Be strong in presentation skills / sales
  - Explain the things that need explaining
Get the users' goals
Do Testing
Do Research
Attitude trumps work
Big companies -> politics trumps work
In a political situation:
  - Find a small hard-working group (they help with shielding from the political situation)
First impressions are forever
  Slow track if you start low and don't move quickly
  People see you for who you were when they met you
"We have met the enemy, and he is us"
  - I am what stands between me & success
How to socialize
  - Go to Meetups
  - Break the ice with speakers and attendees
Slight of hand
  - Share around the problem
  - Focus on the wins
  - Doesn't necessarily have to be a full coverage of the design, just on the parts that are true to you
As a client, express expectations and requirements explicitly
Don't solve the problem for a designer
What do I do when I can't influence direction/change
  - Blog like no one's reading
  - Writing thoughts means having thoughts
  - The more you write the more you'll believe in your philosophy
Don't wait for someone to hand you your dream job
  - Know yourself, change yourself
  - Manage your managers
  - Blogs and side projects show what you think, and can do
