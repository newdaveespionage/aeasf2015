Designing for Touch
===================



Touch region is becoming harder to predict, so designing interfaces is more about the known hit spots

Molecular movable interfaces

Moving controls closer to the bottom on command seems cheap/giving up

Larger/Tablet screens the bottom of the screen becomes less important or even hostile
Useful for previewing, but may still be blocking interaction, sides are better

Hover is an enhancement (think progressive enhancement)

Big touch targets: 7mm to 9mm (1% to 0.5% miss rate)

Do we offer zooming of touch area as well as text? Will pinch to zoom outside of the browser be something we need to provide?

The pixel has been redefined, 1/96in

Density vs. Touchy

AVOID THE TRIPLE TRIPLE (9 patties of burger)

Conversational style vs. Monologue style
- how much information do I need up-front vs. let the user ask
- clarity trumps density

Sometimes the best touch interactions don't even involve touch

Informing passively (data graphs to indicate info that can help selections)

Not everyone is a stranger

Some information can be determined/informed by other actions/data

Kay Jewelers checkout: 40 form fields... how to reduce?

Undo instead of confirm (ask for forgiveness instead of permission)

Garbage Tap Kids, collect 'em all!
- reduce needless interface interactions when it's possible to reduce

Swipe has purpose

Double-tap has purpose (300 microseconds for delay between taps)

Disabling zoom is a bad idea

"I hate that back button with the force of a million suns. Why can't I just use coarse gestures?"

Wide brush strokes are the missing link in some contexts

are we really ok with the portmanteau "phablets"?? #aeasf  i can't say that seriously.

Moving the controls on your device to keep everything in the thumb zone feels a little like giving up. #sotrue #aeasf @bigmediumjosh

mental note: overlay thumb maps for various devices on my responsive designs to check for nav & action placement @bigmediumjosh #aeasf
so weird, the ways some big phones and phablets can "shrink" the UI to make things easier to reach. seems hacky. @bigmediumjosh #aeasf
i really like the floating "exploding snowball" pattern for actions. what are the downsides, e.g. covering content? @bigmediumjosh #aeasf

Use of share buttons on mobile sites is low - users prefer to use native share functionality. #aeasf
