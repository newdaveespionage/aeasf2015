Designing for Touch
===================

Touch region is becoming harder to predict, so designing interfaces is more about the known hit spots

Molecular movable interfaces

Moving controls closer to the bottom on command seems cheap/giving up

Larger/Tablet screens the bottom of the screen becomes less important or even hostile
Useful for previewing, but may still be blocking interaction, sides are better
