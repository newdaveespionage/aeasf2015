Unified UX
- Behavior Translation can be an issue when things don't act the way you expect
- Muscle Memory / Intuition

The interface and content lines are blurred
User engagement is about stories

The landscape of interfaces (screens?) has grown and diversified

The idea of responsive is now spanning devices and apps

The definition of how users use small portable screen does not meet the expectations defined in the past (on the go)

Seamless interface translation

RWD = now RD = Unified UX

Forming a united whole

Cohesive Unified aspect
- Function AND Form
- Avoid jarring changes between wide screen and small screen versions

Good examples:
- Amazon
- Gmail

Challenges
- Complex filtering (app like functionality) makes responsive design difficult
- Myfonts.com does it well

Data Symmetry
- Remote control
- Continuity of sessions (Zappos didn't allow workflow from desktop to the mobile, now does)

Best Practices
- Unify your internet presence, not just web (everything, apps, everything)
- Unify elements identified across all user experiences
- Consider using Web Views
- Unify Actions, not just content
- Sync verbs, not just nouns
- Session data continuity
- Verb specificity: replace "click" with "tap" or "press"
- Eliminate Big-Screen bloat
- Do what works best for the audience, not what people say about audiences
- The best interface is the one within reach
