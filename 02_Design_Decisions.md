Design Decisions Through the Lens of Performance
================================================
*By Yesenia Perez-Cruz*

Slow heavy websites are the result of poor:
- planning
- communication
- awareness

Design is a balancing act between:
- Performance
- Pretty

Fast sites:
- build trust
- are memorable

Shoppers:
- 2 seconds load
- will visit competitors site if it loads faster by 250ms

Tools can also contribute to slowdowns

Examples of designing for performance
The Guardian - 1s content load, 4s full load

How to:
1. Prioritize performance
2. Set a performance budget
3. Be deliberate (design with purpose)
4. Communicate (team, clients about performance)

Create a UX assessment
- do full scan of site for existing UX situation
Identify strengths and weaknesses (SWOT?)
- see slide for examples
Share case studies
- discuss results publicly
Performance Goals can be:
- Browser based
- Experience based
Performance goals set thresholds for optimization

20% rule, people perceive things as different in matters of 20%

Start discussing Performance Budget at start of project
Check in on meeting the budget throughout the project
Divide budget into subsets (fonts, images, css, javascript, html, content?, json?)

Do more with less
- How many fonts am I using, are they needed?
- Be prepared for situations where the fonts won't even load

Delivering Pizza
- fast food Pizza business is about speed
- their sites are really Slow
- quality = performance, stability, reliability
- performance is a marketable feature
- speed Testing
- data weight over the time of a process (ordering a pizza)
- performance mission: beautiful, flexible, lightning-fast, experience
- Budget set at 600kb per page
- Challenges
  - Branding shift during project
    - Impact to fonts
    - Budget of 100kb
  - Unexpected feedback
    - Needs that impact performance
    - Determining ways to work with Needs
    - Reprioritize, scale back in other places

Delivering the News
- News sites
  - can be ad heavy
  - lots of large images
  - users may be on slower bandwidths
- Goal: Deliver it quickly, esp. to mobile audiences
- Determine ad load
- Started with Typography and Colors, simple mockup
- Hold back from designing beyond what's needed
- Edit frequently
- Get designs into code faster
- Including performance optimizations in design phase
