Magical UX and the Internet of Things
=====================================
By Josh Clark

Automated gadgetry
Magic wands (combining voice and physical action to create interaction)

Shareability using gestures (coding overnight drinking wine on a boat)

Gestures as a vocabulary
Natural interactions where technology intersects
Creating magic

I. Magic & technology

"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."

The interface is everything

Anything can be a controller

How do we design interactions with information?

"We don't want brands all over our home"

Take the good things from mobile and apply them to our interactions elsewhere

II. Physical Meets Digital

Ambient intelligence

No new behavior required

Collective data can help improve community health, not just individual

interactions to control things requires controllers that we wear, or are someplace we go

Room E

The room is smart enough to know what the hell you're doing.

AND HOW TO KILL YOU

But really, don't be a jerk, it's possible to invade privacy far too easily, so respect is needed.
