Social Mediblah

An effective social media campaign is based on the psychology of social behaviors, not current tech.

Anything that blocks interaction and ease of use is not a part of social interaction

Social interaction is an afterthought, buttons at the bottom of the site/content/section

Magic is expected to happen with social media buttons, when really it's not something that "just happens"

Data, social media is critical

It's not as simple as follower counts

If we're happy, our clients are happy

Basic social ecosystem:
- the heart is your persona and tone of voice

It's important to be consistent

Conversion from social (twitter) 0.04%
1/4 of your followers will be paying attention
think of it as a campfire (close knit)

"There's far too much Bieber in my presentation for my liking"

Tribe Behaviour - validates a way to act as "right"

Commitment vs. Authenticity
Commitment
  - you could count on their content
Authenticity
  - high quality, but not advertising

What if you combined the idea of a hair salon with social media specialist services, creating a more human/accessible salon
- Blushbar
- Beta tested with friends and family
- Instagram is not for polished imagery?
  - what about professional photographers?
- Very authentic imagery, stock-looking gets no attention, even if its real.
- Admit your mistakes

The Lightbulb Moment
- Don't do the safe expected things
- Don't do what everyone else is doing
- Don't do what social media experts are telling you to do
- Think of your social media brand as a community

Seth Godin:
- It's ok to abandon the stock tribe
