Content In Context Is King
==========================
*By Derek Featherstone*

So many distinctive moments happen out of spontenaiety, in circumstances that cannot be reproduced with the same scale of result.

Incredibly contextual, require so much circumstance and environmental influence.

Our integration of digital into our lives has some interesting nuances where we don't actually see the complexities we've introduced into our own lives.

Without the addiction, we wouldn't capture moments that mean a lot to us

Context extends beyond device

If it was sold out or too late to register, the content provided a different CTA (newsletter sign up)

Geolocation can really clarify the context of your user when centered around events or purpose-driven aspects of your app/site/interface, issue is that acceptance dialog is vague

Change prioritization of information dependent on search and sorting mechanisms

- What resolutions do we design for? All of them.
- "Please complete the form [removed on small screens] to the right." I fully expect someone to be standing to my right with a form. #aeasf
- Reverse-device-discrimination happens. Don't assume that only users on mobile devices need location- or time-specific info. @feather #aeasf

- CSS Grids could make adjusting layouts to match content priority even easier! #justsaying #aeasf

- Context is often seen as a device thing. It's about time, location, proximity, capabilities, activities, interests, interaction... #aeasf

- context mapping = measuring content priority over time, e.g. pre-event, during event, after event @fether #aeasf

- Geolocation begs us to present contextually relevant info (e.g. in an airline app, when the user is at the airport). @feather #aeasf
